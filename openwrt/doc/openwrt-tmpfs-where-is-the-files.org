#+title: Openwrt /tmp used 46% where is the files?
#+options: ^:nil

* reference
https://serverfault.com/questions/488132/tmp-used-100-where-is-files

* background
The AP's cached memory cannot be dropped.

And I noticed the /tmp occupation reached 47%, 28.3M has been used.
#+BEGIN_SRC info
root@xx:/tmp# df -h | grep \/tmp
tmpfs                    60.4M     28.3M     32.2M  47% /tmp
#+END_SRC

But there is no big file larger than 1MB exist in /tmp, how could it be?

* analysis

** use `lsof' for analysis
You should use
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# lsof /tmp
#+END_SRC
to see currently opened file. If you delete a file, while a software still have a lock on it,
you won't see it anymore, but it will still have hd space assigned to it.

When you check the LSOF result, the `deleted' give you an idea of which file now only exist in
memory. Stopping the relevant process should free the space.

** do check
#+BEGIN_SRC info

When I kill the a_manage, and wxm, I can drop the cached memory now.

So, the logs operation of wxm and a_manage should be verified to fix this issue.
